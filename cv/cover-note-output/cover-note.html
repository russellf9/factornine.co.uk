<p>Hi</p>
I’m currently looking for a new role focused on Angular JS and or Hybrid mobile development.

I'm looking to work with a great team in a London location either contract or full-time.
In the last year have focusing on Angular.js and Hybrid mobile development. I’ve successfully built web applications for McDonalds’s and PTASocial, using Firebase and PlayFramework respectively.

Also, I have recently launched an educational game on iTunes.

-  Magic Square Game - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-square-game/id966245243?ls=1&mt=8
My Github is at: https://github.com/russellf9.

Pertinent examples include:

- A hybrid app using Ionic: https://github.com/russellf9/magic-squares-mobile

- Ionic app using WebRTC:  https://github.com/russellf9/f9-ionic-webrtc

- `Scheduling` app using Angular and Firebase:  https://github.com/russellf9/schedule-tool
If you want to call me, my number is 07932 025 044.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks Russell Wenban
