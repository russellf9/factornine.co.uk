# CV


## Description

I'm in the process of automating the process of writing my CV in formats for web and distribution.


## Instructions

To create the output files from the source:

```
# CD to `factornine.co.uk/cv`
sh cv.sh
```


## Result

The script creates a cv in docx format using the days date like: `cv-210127.docx`.

The output needs to be tidied up before distributing as a document.

Also, a more verbose cv in html format is created which is fine for my website.
