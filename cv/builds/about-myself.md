### About Myself

#### Current Role [Headline only] 

My last role was at Qudini
where my main responsibility was the upkeep
of the B2B webapp written in AngularJS and React 

Unfortunately, I was one of many redundancies last month.

(I will be more detailed about Qudini later)


#### College / Study / How I got into the business

My original background was in the "Arts", studying film and multimedia.

My introduction to the technology business  was during the dotcom era where I started with Flash animation
and gradually shifted my focus to the programming side with ActionScript.

My original roles were more like "multimedia" roles with an emphasis on design

I studied a course at Birkbeck Colleage UCL to cement my Computer Science knowledge.


#### Post College and Onwards

- I had lots of short contracts completing a variety of projects. Including lots of Flash games and creation of content with dynamic video.

- I worked for a couple of E-Learning companies (Espresso and Videotel) for longer periods of time. I really enjoyed the process of working within a team to create a educational content that had a real purpose.

- As Flash was dying I had learn a new Framework(?) and picked AngularJS as this looked pretty powerful and was a technology in demand. I completed a few small projects in AngularJS as a freelancer.


#### Current Role (last Role) [Details]

- See Qudini Experience below...


#### Outside of work

I am very interested in keeping fit and have a daily morning exercise routine which has been beneficial physically and mentally in these interesting times!

When possible I am a frequent attendee and sometimes contributer at tech meetups for React Native and Node Users Group London.


#### Wrap Up

I'm looking for a role where the emphasis is "people" and "team" 
and believe from what I've learnt about Checkatrade
that I will have the opportunity to put both my technical and soft skills to practice 
so I can be part of a team making a great product
which will benefit the stakeholders.
