Iâ€™m very interested in the role advertised.

I believe I would be a good fit as I have extensive experience of working with a variety of JavaScript flavours and handling different bank-end environments.

I have the ability to problem solve and am a great advocate for Agile methodology, with a passion for forming teams being willing to and able to mentor others whilst enthusiastically learning from other teammates.

I have been in the game for 15 years and have developed a variety of projects for leading e-learning companies, design agencies and start-ups.
