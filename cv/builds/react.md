## React specific skills and experience 

Whilst at Qudini I helped to create a hybrid React Application which enabled new features to built using React on top of the existing AngularJS WebApp.

The tech stack included **Typescript** (with strict types), **Redux**, **RxJS** and **Jest** for unit testing.

After an initial steep learning curve I was able to implement Types, understand how to incorporate Observables, and implement Actions and Epics so I could successfully complete new features.

For some features (keeping a local state of an upload button for example) I’ve used **React Hooks**.

As a team we had a commitment to high test coverage (we had roughly 80% test coverage) so I’m comfortable with unit-testing components with snapshots, also testing Epics and Selectors.

I also used **Faker** to create mock test data for sharable Fixtures.

As we progressed as a team we introduced Styled Components which replaced inline styles so I’m experienced in implementing designs from Zeplin into React Components.

I’m competent using various libraries such as **Immutable-js** and **Lodash** to implement readable pure functions.

I’m competent in using both **Fetch** and **Axios** for api calls for consuming APIs.
