In the last year have focusing on Angular.js and Hybrid mobile development. I’ve successfully built web applications for McDonalds’s and PTASocial, using Firebase and PlayFramework respectively. Also, I have recently launched an educational game on iTunes.

Pertinent examples include:

• A hybrid app using Ionic: [magic-squares-mobile](https://github.com/russellf9/magic-squares-mobile)
